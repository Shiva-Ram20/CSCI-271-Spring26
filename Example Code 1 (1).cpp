#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int total = 0;
    int counter = 1;
    
    while (counter <= 10){
        int grade;
        cin >> grade;

}

/* Reflection:
1. This program allows us to find the average grade in a class with a fixed number of 10 students.
It starts by declaring 'total' and setting it to 0 and declaring 'counter' to 1. 
It utilizes a while iteration statement with the condition that the counter should be less than or equal to 10.
After declaring 'grade', it asks for inputs from the user. For every input, the counter increases until it reaches to 10.
At the end, it declares 'average' and calculates it through converting 'total' to type 'double' and dividing it by 10.
2. I had difficulty understanding the importance of static_cast<double>
3. I reviewed examples utilized in class alongside with the lecture slides
4. Used ChatGPT to better understand static_cast<double> and how it affects the program.
5. I learnt that counter iteration statements is an efficient way to receive multiple inputs
